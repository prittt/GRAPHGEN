## Requirements

### Windows
No further requirements. yaml-cpp and graphviz are distributed (as submodule and executable respectively) with Graphgen.

### Linux
* [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) for producing SVG representations of the generated graphs, using the `dot` command. Can be installed e.g. through apt: `sudo apt install graphviz`.
