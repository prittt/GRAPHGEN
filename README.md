<!--MAIN-DATA-BEGIN-->

<p align="justify">
GRAPHGEN is a general open-source framework for optimizing algorithms that can be modeled with decision tables, such as Connected Components Labeling, Thinning, Chain Code (Contour Tracing), and Morphological operators. Generally, all image processing algorithms where the output value for each pixel is a function of the pixel itself and some of its neighbors can be defined in such a way. The framework allows to automatically apply many different optimization strategies to a given problem, taking as input its definition in terms of <em>conditions</em> to be checked and <em>actions</em> to be performed, and directly produces the C++ code including those optimizations as output.
</p>

In short, GRAPHGEN is able to:


* <p align="justify"> Generate the Optimal Decision Tree (ODTree) associated to a given problem <a href="#HYPERCUBE">[1]</a>;</p>
* <p align="justify"> Compress the ODTree into a Directed Rooted Acyclic Graph (DRAG), in order to better fit instruction cache <a href="#DRAG">[2]</a>;</p>
* <p align="justify"> Apply pixel (or state) prediction <a href="#EFM">[3]</a>, <a href="#CTB">[4]</a> thus generating a Forest of Decision Trees (FDTrees) from the original ODTtree. Prediction allows to recycle information obtained in the previous step, thus saving memory accesses and reducing total execution time <a href="#PRED">[5]</a>;</p>
* <p align="justify"> Remove boundary checks by generating special Decision Trees (DTtrees) for the start/end of the line and special FDTrees for the first/last line <a href="#Spaghetti">[6]</a>;</p>
* <p align="justify"> Compress the FDT into a multi-rooted acyclic graph in order to better fit instruction cache;</p>
* <p align="justify"> Introduce pattern frequencies in the generation of ODTs to better fit real data and improve the performance of algorithms over a particular use-case scenario.</p>

<p align="justify">
As mentioned, the generation process is only related to the definition of the problem, meaning that the same problem can be solved using different definitions such as exploiting different scanning masks <a href="#CTB">[4]</a>, <a href="#SAUF">[7]</a>, <a href="#BBDT">[8]</a>, <a href="#CCIT">[9]</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">
For all the aforementioned optimization strategies GRAPHGEN is able to generate both the visual representation of the Decision Tree/Forest/DRAG and the C++ code implementing it.
</p>

<b><i>Tested Platforms</i>: Windows (VS2017), Linux (GCC 9.x or later).</b>

## How to Run GRAPHGEN
### Requirements (Windows)
* For compiling: Visual Studio 2017 or later;
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.12 or later;
* OpenCV 3.x (optional, only needed for frequency calculation);
* graphviz (included in the repository as executable);
* yaml-cpp (included in the repository as submodule).


### Requirements (Linux)
* For compiling: GCC 9.x or later (for full std::filesystem support);
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 3.12 or later;
* [graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/) for producing SVG representations of the generated graphs, using the `dot` command;
* OpenCV 3.x (optional, only needed for frequency calculation);
* yaml-cpp (included in the repository as submodule).

### Setup
* Install the requirements as described above;
* Open CMake and point it to the root directory of this repository. The build folder can be e.g. a subfolder called `bin` or `build`.
* Select "Configure";
* Important variables to set:
    * `GRAPHGEN_FREQUENCIES_ENABLED`: enables frequency calculation and corresponding build targets (e.g. `Spaghetti_FREQ`). If enabled:
    `OpenCV_DIR` points to the build folder of an OpenCV 3.x installation with identical architecture and compiler, and `GRAPHGEN_FREQUENCIES_DATASET_DOWNLOAD` must be enabled if you wish to download the datasets used in frequency calculation (archive size: ca. 2-3 GB). This flag is mandatory for frequency calculation if you have not downloaded the dataset before.
    * **On Linux**: if you wish to change the architecture to 64-bit (default is 32-bit), change occurences of `-m32` to `-m64` in `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`;
    * **On Linux**: you can adjust the build type by setting `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` (`Release` preferred for faster decision tree and forest calculation).
* Select "Generate" to generate the project.
* Build and execute the project: 
    * **On Windows**: open the generated project solution, select the desired start-up target, build and execute either in Debug or Release mode.
    * **On Linux**: `cd` into the build folder, run `make` command and then execute one of the built targets (e.g. `./SAUF`).
* The outputs (generated code and graphs) of the executables will be stored inside the build folder in a subfolder called `outputs` (e.g. `GRAPHGEN/build/outputs/SAUF/SAUF_tree.svg`).

## Configuring GRAPHGEN
Some application behaviors can be configured by changing the `config.yaml` in the build folder. 

- `force_odt_generation` - boolean value that forces the optimal decision tree to be (re)generated with every execution. This may be necessary for debug purposes:

``` yaml
force_odt_generation: false
```

- `datasets` - list of datasets to be used for frequency calculation. All the [YACCLAB](https://github.com/prittt/YACCLAB) datasets are available if the  `GRAPHGEN_FREQUENCIES_DATASET_DOWNLOAD` flag was set during the configuration: 

``` yaml
datasets: ["fingerprints", "hamlet", "3dpes", "xdocs", "tobacco800", "mirflickr", "medical", "classical"]
```

- `paths` - dictionary with both input (folder containing the datasets used for frequency calculation) and output (where output code, graphs, and frequenices will be stored) paths. It is automatically initialized by CMake: 

``` yaml
paths: {input: "<datasets_path>", output: "<output_results_path>"}
```

- `dot` - dictionary to configure dot output format. Three different configuration parameters are available: 
    * `out_format` - output format of the generated graphs. Currently supported formats are `"pdf"`, `"png"`, and `"svg"`;
    * `background` - background color of the generated graphs. It can be one of the colors supported by dot, such as `"white"`, `"red"`, `"turquoise"`, `"sienna"`, `"transparent"`, etc;
    * `ranksep` - vertical separation for objects belonging to two consecutive lines of the output graph.

``` yaml
dot: {out_format: "svg", background: "transparent", ranksep: "0.5"}
```
