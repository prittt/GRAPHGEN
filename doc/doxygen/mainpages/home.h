<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
GRAPHGEN is the all encompassing GAPhs GENerator! It is a general open-source framework for optimizing the performance of many binary image processing algorithms. Starting from just a set of rules, it automatically generates decision trees with minimum path-length considering image pattern frequencies, then applies state prediction and code compression producing Directed Rooted Acyclic Graphs (DRAG) that combine these different optimization techniques. You can find a theoretical description of GRAPHGEN capabilities <a href="2020_CVPR_One_DAG_to_Rule_Them_All.pdf">here</a>. 

<h3>2. How to Install and Run GRAPHGEN</h3>

<h3>3. Code Structure</h3>
The source code contains the library itself and a dozens of example targets specific for different algorithms, already available in literature or newly generated with GRAPHGEN. A complete list description follows:
