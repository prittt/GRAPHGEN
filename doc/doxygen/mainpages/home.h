<h2 class="num">Introduction</h2>
GRAPHGEN is the all encompassing GRAPHs GENerator! It is a general open-source framework for optimizing the performance of many binary image processing algorithms. Starting from just a set of rules, it automatically generates decision trees with minimum path-length considering image pattern frequencies, then applies state prediction and code compression producing Directed Rooted Acyclic Graphs (DRAG) that combine these different optimization techniques. You can find a theoretical description of GRAPHGEN capabilities <a href="2020_CVPR_One_DAG_to_Rule_Them_All.pdf">here</a>. In short, GRAPHGEN is able to:
- generate the Optimal Decision Tree (ODTree) associated to a given problem <a href="#HYPERCUBE">[1]</a>;
- compress the ODT into a Directed Rooted Acyclic Graph (DRAG) and generate it, in order to better fit instruction cache <a href="#DRAG">[2]</a>
- apply pixel (or state) prediction <a href="#EFM">[3]</a>,<a href="#CTB">[4]</a> thus generating a Forest of Decision Trees (FDTrees) from the original ODTree. Prediction allows to recycle information obtained in the previous step in the current one, thus saving memory accesses and reducing the total execution time <a href="#PRED">[5]</a>;
- remove condition checks by generating special Decision Trees (DTrees) for the start/end of the line and special FDTrees for the first/last line <a href="#Spaghetti">[6]</a>;
- compress the FDTrees into a multi-rooted acyclic graph in order to better fit instruction cache;
- introduce frequencies in the generation of ODTrees to better fit data and improve the performance of an algorithm over a particular use-case scenario;

As mentioned, the generation process is only related to the definition of the problem, meaning that the same problem can be solved using different definitions such as exploiting different scanning masks <a href="#CTB">[4]</a>, <a href="#SAUF">[7]</a>, <a href="#BBDT">[8]</a>, <a href="#CCIT">[9]</a>. For all the aforementioned optimization strategies GRAPHGEN is able to generate both the visual representation of the Decision Tree/Forest/DRAG and the C/C++ code implementing it.

<b>Supported platforms</b>: Windows (VS2017), Linux (GCC 9.x or later).

<h2 class="num">How to Run GRAPHGEN</h2>
<h3 class="nocount">2.1 Requirements (Windows)</h3>
- For compiling: Visual Studio 2017 (later versions are not tested).
- <a href="https://cmake.org/" target="_blank">CMake</a> 3.12 or later.
- OpenCV 3.x (optional, only needed for frequency calculation).
- graphviz (included in the repository as executable).
- yaml-cpp (included in the repository as submodule).

<h3 class="nocount">2.2 Requirements (Linux)</h3>
- For compiling: GCC 9.x or later (for full std::filesystem support).
- <a href="https://cmake.org/" target="_blank">CMake</a> 3.12 or later.
- <a href="https://www.graphviz.org/download/" target="_blank">graphviz</a> for producing SVG representations of the generated graphs, using the `dot` command. Can be installed e.g. through apt: `sudo apt install graphviz`.
- OpenCV 3.x (optional, only needed for frequency calculation).
- yaml-cpp (included in the repository as submodule).

<h3 class="nocount">2.3 Setup</h3>
- Install the requirements as described above.
- Open CMake and point it to the root directory of this repository. The build folder can be e.g. a subfolder called "bin" or "build".
- Press "Configure".
- These are important variables to set:
    - `GRAPHGEN_FREQUENCIES_ENABLED`: enables frequency calculation and corresponding build targets (e.g. `Spaghetti_FREQ`). If enabled:
        - `OpenCV_DIR`: Point to the build folder of an OpenCV 3.x install with identical architecture and compiler.
        - `GRAPHGEN_FREQUENCIES_DATASET_DOWNLOAD`: enable if you wish to download the datasets used in frequency calculation (archive size: ca. 2-3 GB). Madatory for frequency calculation if you have not downloaded them before.
    - On Linux: if you wish to change the architecture to 64-bit (default is 32-bit), change occurences of `-m32` to `-m64` in `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS` and `CMAKE_C_FLAGS`.
    - On Linux: you can adjust the build type in `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` (`Release` preferred for faster decision tree and forest calculation).
- Press "Generate" to generate the project files.
- Build and execute the project:
    - On Windows: open the generated project solution, select the desired start-up target and execute either in Debug or Release.
    - On Linux: `cd` into the build folder, `make` and then execute one of the built targets (e.g. `./SAUF`).
- The outputs (generated code and graphs) of the executables will be stored inside the build folder in a subfolder called `outputs` (e.g. `GRAPHGEN/build/outputs/SAUF/SAUF_tree.svg`).

<h3 class="nocount">2.4 Configuring GRAPHGEN</h3>
Some application behavior can be configured by changing the `config.yaml` in the build folder.

- `force_odt_generation`: forces the optimal decision tree to be generated in every execution. This may be necessary when implementing own algorithms and debugging them. *Default: false*
- `datasets`: datasets used for frequency calculation. Available datasets from the [YACCLAB dataset](https://github.com/prittt/YACCLAB#the-yacclab-dataset) (downloaded with `GRAPHGEN_FREQUENCIES_DATASET_DOWNLOAD`): `"3dpes"`, `"check"`, `"fingerprints"`, `"hamlet"`, `"medical"`, `"mirflickr"`, `"tobacco800"`, `"xdocs"`, `"classical"`, `"granularity"`
- `paths`:
    - `input`: path to the folder containing the datasets used for frequency calculation.
    - `output`: path where all outputs (code, graphs, frequenices) will be stored
- `dot`:
    - `out_format`: output format of the generated graphs. Currently supported: `"pdf"`, `"png"`, and `"svg"`. *Default: svg*
    - `background`: background color of the generated graphs. It can be one of the color supported by dot, such as `"white"`, `"red"`, `"turquoise"`, `"sienna"`, `"transparent"`, etc.
